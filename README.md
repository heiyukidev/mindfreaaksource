# MindFreaak

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## All the Data
I Usually don't store data in components, there's a service directory where i have all the data in Info.servce.ts
Just Add as much data as you want in the JSON, the website will take shape.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng build` Then copy the content in the `dist/` directory into the other repo.
This is your Dev Repo, and the other is your Production repo
That's why i always say: "Let's go into production :3"
# Important!
Be carefull not to delete the files in `dist/` called "CNAME" and "README.md"
all the other file are generated buy Angular, Thus replacable by the new Build
